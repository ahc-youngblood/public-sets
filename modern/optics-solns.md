a) $\theta_1$ is the angle between the incoming light ray and the first (from the left) dashed surface normal. $\theta_2$ is the angle between the light path labeled $L$ and the same dashed line. $\theta_3$ is the angle between the light path $L$ and the second dashed surface normal and $\theta_4$ is the angle between the outgoing light ray and the same second (from the left) dashed line.

b) $\theta_2$ and $\theta_3$ are equal because the two faces of the prism of length $h$ are parallel to each other so these two angles are alternate interior angles. $\theta_1$ and $\theta_4$ are therefore equal to each other because the first first two angles are equal 

$$
n_1\sin\theta_1 = n_2\sin\theta_2 = n_2\sin\theta_3 = n_1\sin\theta_4
$$
c) The figure makes sense as long as $n_1 < n_2$

d) 
$90^\circ - \theta_1 + \alpha + \theta_2 = 90^\circ$ 
$\Rightarrow \theta_1 - \theta_2 = \alpha$
